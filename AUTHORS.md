Vendored Code
-------------

### Argon2

The original Argon2 repo can be found at [github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2).

Except for the components listed below, the Argon2 code in this repository is copyright (c) 2015 Daniel Dinu, Dmitry Khovratovich (main authors), Jean-Philippe Aumasson and Samuel Neves, and under [CC0] license.

The string encoding routines in src/encoding.c are copyright (c) 2015 Thomas Pornin, and under [CC0] license.

The [BLAKE2](https://blake2.net>) code in `src/blake2` is copyright (c) Samuel Neves, 2013-2015, and under [CC0] license.

The authors of Argon2 also were very helpful to get the library to compile on ancient versions of Visual Studio for ancient versions of Python.

The documentation also quotes frequently from the [Argon2 paper](https://password-hashing.net/argon2-specs.pdf) to avoid mistakes by rephrasing.


### msinttypes

In order to be able to compile on Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2010 which are required for Python 2.7 and 3.4 respectively, we also ship two C headers with integer types.
They are from the [msinttypes project](https://code.google.com/p/msinttypes/) ([auto-import on GitHub](https://github.com/chemeris/msinttypes)) and licensed under New BSD:
